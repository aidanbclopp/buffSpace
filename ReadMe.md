## Description

BuffSpace is a web-based social networking platform exclusively for the CU Boulder community, inspired by the classic MySpace experience. Users can create personal profiles showcasing their major and academic year, with each new user automatically connected to Chip, the school mascot, as their first friend.

The platform features the "BuffCircle" (similar to MySpace's "Top 8"), a campus event calendar, and interest-based groups for majors, clubs, and sports teams. Users can interact through status updates, photos, blog posts, messaging, and forum discussions.

This nostalgic yet modern platform aims to strengthen the CU Boulder community by providing a school-spirit focused social network accessible via web browsers.
