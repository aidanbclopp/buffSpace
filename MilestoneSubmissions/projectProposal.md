## Application Name: *BuffSpace*

   ### Application Description:

   BuffSpace is a web-based social networking platform exclusively designed for the CU Boulder community that reimagines the classic MySpace experience through a CU Boulder lens. The platform allows students and alumni to create profile pages, detailing information about them: Such as major and year. Every new user is automatically connected with Chip, the school mascot, as their first friend, establishing an immediate connection to campus culture and traditions.

   At its core, BuffSpace combines creative expression with community engagement through features like the "BuffCircle" (similar to MySpace's "Top 8"), a campus event calendar, and interest-based groups aligned with majors, clubs, and sports teams. Users can share status updates, photos, and blog posts while connecting through a messaging system, and forum board.

   The application addresses the need for a more personalized and school-spirit-focused social network. By focusing on campus-specific culture, BuffSpace aims to strengthen the CU Boulder community bond while providing a nostalgic yet modern social networking experience. The platform will be accessible a web browser.

   ### Vision Statement

   For the community of CU Boulder, who seek a creative and nostalgic platform to express themselves, the *BuffSpace* app is a social networking site that allows users to customize their profiles and connect with others through school-themed interactions. Unlike modern social media platforms, our product brings back the charm of early Myspace with personalized layouts and the inclusion of a first friend—the school mascot—to foster school pride and community engagement.
