6. For students of CU Boulder, who need a place to network with other students at the university online. BuffSpace is an social networking platform that gives a safe place for only students of CU to be able to host profiles, create posts, and communicate with one another. Unlike MySpace, our product is catered toward the student body of the University of Colorado to offer a safer and more restricted space to focus on keeping students connected with one another.
