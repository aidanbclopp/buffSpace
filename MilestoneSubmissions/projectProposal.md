6. For the community of CU Boulder, who seek a creative and nostalgic platform to express themselves, the BoulderSpace app is a social networking site that allows users to customize their profiles and connect with others through school-themed interactions. Unlike modern social media platforms, our product brings back the charm of early Myspace with personalized layouts and the inclusion of a first friend—the school mascot—to foster school pride and community engagement.
